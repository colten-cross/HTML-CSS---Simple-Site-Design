# SimpleSiteTemplate
A very basic site template I created, with an iPhone-style scrolling icon theme

I was tasked with creating a simple front end that end users would use to navigate the different IT services we had to offer in our department.

This was my project about halfway through the completed product, without any actual specific work information or details included, and very pastel/basic coloring. 

Nowadays, people are more used to their handheld devices, and scrolling is something that comes naturally. I decided to incorporate that scrollable-style into this site template. 

This template has been coded to be easily customizable and versatile, simple HTML and CSS. 


NOTE: I do plan on using this template to create a full functioning mock website in the near future.
